#  This UI code contains the global UI of the application. It calls
#  header, body and sidebar (which is NULL in this case) and load all
#  javascript libraries such as shinyJS, extendShinyjs, MathJax... as well
#  as the theme by default which is cerulean (can be changed with theme selector)

#  bsplus only works with R > 3.3, so pay attention to update R before installing
#  other packages. On shiny-server, always install R packages by running R in the
#  shiny folder. Put the app in src/shiny-server/myApp and access via:
#  server_ip:3838/myApp
