#'
#' Explore calcium (Ca) and phosphate (Pi) homeostasis with two novel 'Shiny' apps,
#' building upon on a previously published mathematical model written in C,
#' to ensure efficient computations. The underlying model is accessible
#' here <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28747359>.
#' The first application explores the fundamentals of Ca-Pi homeostasis,
#' while the second provides interactive case studies for in-depth exploration of the topic,
#' thereby seeking to foster student engagement and an integrative understanding of Ca-Pi regulation.
#' These applications are hosted at <https://rinterface.com/AppsPhysiol.html>.
