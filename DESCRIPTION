Description: Explore short and long-term blood presure regulation mechanisms with two novel 'Shiny' apps. 
    The first application explores the fundamentals of principles of blood pressure regulation, 
    while the second provides interactive case studies for in-depth exploration of the topic, 
    thereby seeking to foster student engagement and an integrative understanding. 
    These applications are hosted at <https://rinterface.com/AppsPhysiol.html>.
